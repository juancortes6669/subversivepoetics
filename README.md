In the midst of the digital revolution and the new global dynamics that characterize the last twenty years of the 21st century, 
women artists have taken on a fundamental voice. This curatorship addresses proposals by 8 women of special importance in the 
development of new media and contemporary digital arts. From reflections on the role of technology in the construction of identity, 
to the subversive use of technology for questioning and alternatives to contemporary problems, to the fictionalization of historical moments, 
this curatorship aims to present a frame of reference on the creation of new media and the use and disuse of new technologies.

The first work of the curatorship is Houses in the Forest; the Forest in a House, by Colombian artist Bárbara Santos (COL). 
This work stages the importance of indigenous technologies and the loss of meaning in the processes of translation and archiving 
of ancestral knowledge. This same research base appears in Patricia Dominguez's (CHI) work, Green Irises, where the artist exposes 
the syncretisms, juxtapositions and oppositions between South American indigenous cultures and the technologies and repercussions 
of contemporary lifestyles - extractivism, hyper-consumption, pollution, etc. Dominguez's work encompasses a range of myths, 
symbols and rituals shaped by global finance, from the syncretic cult of Our Lady of Cerro Rico, an infamous silver mine in 
Bolivia in which eight million natives died, to the archaeological museum at Scotiabank's headquarters in Cusco, built on the ruins of an Inca palace. 

Another approach to the loss of diversity in technological models (a phenomenon we call Monotechnology) is found in the 
work of Aarati Akkapeddi (IN|US). In the work Encoding, the artist reflects on the notions of identity in contemporary culture 
and the standardization in the abstractions implied by the devices of recognition and categorization of human beings. 
Aarati proposes an alternative use of these technologies of control by exercising performative rituals of identity construction 
where the standardized models are replaced by a language of codification and translation into digital identity. 
This performative sense is also present in the work of Amor Muñoz Rhythm Manufacture where the artist reflects on contemporary 
work and the standardization and loss of diversity in the identity of workers in maquilas and contemporary hyper-production environments. 
Work and resilience in the midst of extreme environments have been central themes in the work of Janet Biggs (US). 
In Brightness All Around, the artist documents the workday of Linda Norberg, a miner working underground in the Arctic. 
Surrounded by deafening machinery, and relying on her small headlamp for light, she is seen drilling and screwing into the 
ceiling of the newly excavated cave in freezing temperatures and unrelenting darkness. The counterpoint to the terror of the 
underground is provided by the vocal performance of New York music guru Bill Coleman. Using lyrics drawn from near-death experiences. 
Coleman becomes a witness to the struggle to maintain identity in extreme conditions and meaning in the midst of isolation.

The last three curatorial works approach ways of unleashing the potential of technology to directly confront local social issues. 
Who are they? Ana María Montenegro (COL) presents a portal that automates the process of presenting and formulating petition forms 
for the prosecutor's office to clarify what has happened during the last few years in Colombia in reference to the systematic 
annihilation of social leaders around the country's territory. Ingrid Burrington's (US) Submarine Cable Taps is a visualization 
based on Snowden's file on the systematic tapping of transatlantic cables that carry information from internet networks around the world. 
The work highlights the scope of the complex network of relationships between communication and espionage agencies on a global level. 
The last work of the curatorship, by artist Adrien Segal, uses mapping and data visualization as a tool to show the situation of 
water use rights and per capita distribution in the state of California in the USA. Through this technological tool, the artist 
shows the immense problems in the use of the resource by industries where water is exhaustively used and polluted, and the problems 
in thinking about an equitable future for the access to this substantial good in the societies of the future.
